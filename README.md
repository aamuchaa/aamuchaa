# About Me

I grew up in the Chicago suburbs and have lived there my entire life. At home I have one younger sister and a large extended family. I am currently a senior at Iowa State Univeristy majoring in aerosapce engineering heading into my final year. I am most interested in pursing a career in the private space sector, although I am open to anything in the field.
